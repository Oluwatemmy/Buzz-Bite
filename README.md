# Buzz-Bite
 I Created A Blog Website Using Flask and it is called Buzz-Bite.
 
 We offer our subscribers undiluted information on entertainment news, technology, programming, and many worthy contents with occasional humor — and always with blunt honesty.

This app is still in progress, but it currently has features where you can create an account, login to your account and reset your password incase you forgot it, create posts and update or delete them if you are the one that created it, upload a picture and it will be used as your new profile picture and many more

It will be published soon and will be made available for everyone to see and it will also come with more cool features that our users and visitors will enjoy.

Feel free to leave a comment on my overall performance. it will encourage and help me improve.

Special Thanks to AltSchool Africa, Corey Mschafer and everyone who helped me in this journey.   We Continue and move forward always.
